# Farmstar
Farm management system.

*NOTE: This is an aspirational side project, migration onto github is in progress.*

## Vision
Feed 10 billion people.

### Farming Industry problems
- Expensive proprietary hardware and software in machines.
- Complicated unintuitive interfaces.
- Seeding, spraying, harvesting inefficiencies.
- Aging farming expertise.
- Fully autonomous tractors are kinda expensive.
- Some farms here in Australia are bigger than entire countries, mate.

### Goals
*See TODO for specific project goals*

#### Short Term
- Plug and play displays
- Simple clean interface
- Free software on cheap hardware
- On or offline mapping
- Basic positioning
- Heatmap of spray area

#### Medium Term
- Peer-to-peer communication
- High precision positioning
- Mapping activities, seeding, harvesting, spraying.
- Machine messaging
- Timing of tasks


#### Long Term
- Machine interfacing
- Vision systems
- Navigation
- Machine health and diagnostics


#### Dream Big
- Self driving autonomous machines
- Individual plant health recognition vision system
- Machine learning optimization of routes
- End-to-end crop cycle management

### Principles
- High precision farming at the smallest possible cost.
- Intuitive and simple as possible.
- Versatile, work on anything with a screen.
- Primarily developed for RasberyPi.
- Ad-hoc peer-to-peer communication.
