## Vision
Provide low cost farming management system.

### Farming Industry problems
- Expensive proprietary hardware and software in machines.
- Aging farming expertise.
- Some farms here in Australia are bigger than entire countries, mate.

### Mockup (Rev 2.0)

### Goals
*See TODO for specific project goals*

#### Short Term
- Plug and play setup on raspberry pi
- Simple clean interface
- On or offline mapping
- Basic positioning
- Heatmap of spray area
- Lat / Lon grids

#### Medium Term
- Peer-to-peer communication
- High precision positioning
- Mapping activities, seeding, harvesting, spraying.
- Machine messaging
- Timing of tasks

#### Long Term
- Machine interfacing
- Vision systems
- Navigation
- Machine health and diagnostics

#### Dream Big
- Self driving autonomous machines
- Individual plant health recognition vision system
- Machine learning optimization of routes
- End-to-end crop cycle management

### Principles
- High precision farming at the smallest possible cost.
- Intuitive and simple as possible.
- Versatile and modular hardware
    - Use cat5/6 cabling anywhere possible
- Ad-hoc peer-to-peer communication.
- Offline operation

### Design (Rev 2.0)
- Python backend scripts
- Flask Restful API
- MongoDB
- Angular 7
- Mapbox mapping
- Consideration for multiple GPS receivers.
- Plug and play add on hardware such as additional sensors / IO / stereo output / cameras

### About
- Extensive knowledge in wireless mesh technologies
- 10+ years experience in Fleet Management Systems
- Currently work with Autonomous Hauling (driverless dump trucks)
